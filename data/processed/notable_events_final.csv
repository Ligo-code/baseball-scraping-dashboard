1927,"On August 23rd, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts executed two Italian immigrants for a double murder. It was widely believed that the men's reputation as anarchists prevented them from receiving a fair trial and the case remains one of the most controversial in American history. On April 15, 1920, a paymaster for a shoe company in South Braintree, Massachusetts, and his guard were shot and killed by two men who escaped with over $15,000. It was thought from reports of witnesses that the murderers were Italians. The suspects, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were later arrested. Neither, however, had a criminal record, nor was there any evidence of their having had any of the money. In July of 1921, they were found guilty after a trial in Dedham, Massachusetts, and sentenced to death. Years later it was determined that Sacco was probably guilty of the crime, but that Vanzetti was innocent.",Record,"August, April, South Braintree, Nicola Sacco, Bartolomeo Vanzetti","On August 23rd, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts executed two Italian immigrants for a double murde..."

Maris pressed on and finally topped ""The Bambino"" during the final game of the season with number 61 off Tracy Stallard of the Boston Red Sox.
